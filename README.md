Vistock - Visualization to Strategize Investment on MovieStocks

Vistock is a project visualizing and enriching the information provided in the MovieStock pages in Hollywood Stock Exchange (hsx.com) service. HSX is a virtual game imitating the investment in stock market, where the players invest in movies, actors/actresses, and TV shows. The elements, such as History of stock price and trailer are provided. 

However, in according to our research, this information is not enough for players to make a call whether to invest a specific MovieStock or not. In this project, we provide additional objective data from IMDB and boxofficemojo.com integrated in the MovieStock pages and presented the scatter plot format visualization to help players make a better judgement.
